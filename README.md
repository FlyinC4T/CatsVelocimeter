*This project has been a thought/planned idea since 2022 March/April.*
# The Velocimeter | Movement Tracker
Have the ability to track networked clients' character velocity, and judge it based on severity.
## What exactly is this?
This is a mod for Gorilla Tag, that allows the user to track players' speed. This can be used to catch players using cheats that affect the player.
- Example: Check the Velocimeter to see if a player's speed exceeds the default maximum velocity. If so, they might be using a cheat that gives them an extra boost in speed.
###
The mod also tells you if the players' hands are touching a real part of the world. If they happen not to, and their speed is increasing, there's a possibility the player is using cheats that affect their positions
- Positions can be affected by the so-called "AirJump" mod, playspace abusing, and other mods that make the player fly. (Yes, this also includes mods that affect the gravity of players)
- - Note that this could potentially help with catching players using "longarms".
## Notes
- As of now, there is no confirmed release date for this project. A public version may not be present in the near future. (This is only a confirmation of its existence.)
- Any discretionary comment or suggestion may be served for `@_c4t` on Discord.
- - It is worth knowing that most possible additions to this, may already be thought of, and planned.
