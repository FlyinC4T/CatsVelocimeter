# CatsVelocimeter
Track networked clients' character velocity, and judge it based on severity. Justice is served!
## What exactly is this?
This is a mod for Gorilla Tag, that allows the user to track players' speed. This can be used to catch players using cheats that affect the player.
- Example: Check the Velocimeter to see if a player's speed exceeds the default maximum velocity. If so, they might be using a cheat that gives them an extra boost in speed.
The mod also tells you if the players' hands are touching a real part of the world. If they happen not to, and their speed is enhancing, there's a possibility the player is using cheats that affect their positions
- Positions can be affected by the so-called "AirJump" mod, playspace abusing, and other mods that make the player fly.
- Note that this could potentially help with catching players using "longarms".
